## Features
- Object-oriented implementation of a queue.
- Example usage with a main program.
- Well-structured and easy-to-understand code.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started with writing Java code in Visual Studio Code.

### Prerequisites
- Install [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Add the [Java Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) to VS Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains the following folders:

- `src`: The folder to maintain source code.
- `lib`: The folder to maintain dependencies.

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> To customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings accordingly.

## Running the Program
1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Use the **Run and Debug** view or right-click the `Main.java` file in the `src` folder to run the program.
3. The output will be displayed in the terminal.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view in VS Code allows you to manage your dependencies easily. For more details, refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
